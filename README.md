Does your local school have fifty different school uniforms? Do you ever wish their uniforms could be more... uniform? Well, consider your prayers answered!

KK_UniformUniforms assigns all characters who are not wearing proper schoolclothes proper uniforms, and has sliders to create a unified color theme for all attendees. 

## How does it work?
The plugin adds a set of controls to the class menu to set a color scheme for all the characters simultaneously. When you apply this color scheme, two things happen:
- All colors are changed to the current color scheme.
- All non-uniform tops and bottoms are set to random school uniforms.
- All emblems are set to the current school emblems
- The checkboxes at the bottom lets you choose which options you want to apply.

## Planned additions:
- Changing uniforms of background characters
- Customizing which parts are considered a uniform.
- Possibly support for swimsuits / gym clothes
