Does your local school have fifty different school uniforms? Do you ever wish their uniforms could be more... uniform?

KK_UniformUniforms assigns all characters who are not wearing proper uniforms random uniforms, and has sliders to create a unified color theme for all your school attendees. 

## How does it work?
The plugin adds a set of controls to the class menu to set a color scheme for all the characters simultaneously. When you apply this color scheme, two things happen:
- All colors are changed to the current color scheme.
- All non-uniform tops and bottoms are set to random school uniforms, unless you select a specific uniform to apply.
- Option to set uniform emblems to the current school emblem.

- Player customization of which parts are considered a uniform.
